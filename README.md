### Medical Insurance Analysis Plan
This repository contains the code and analysis for a Medical Insurance Charges Prediction project. The goal is to analyze and predict medical insurance charges based on various factors such as age, BMI, smoking status, region, and more. This project demonstrates data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and prediction techniques.

## About the Project
# The Medical Insurance Analysis project aims to gain insights into the factors that influence insurance charges. The analysis utilizes the insurance.csv dataset, which contains information about individualsâ€™ medical insurance coverage, including features such as:
- Age
- Sex
- BMI (Body Mass Index)
- Children (Number of children/dependents)
- Smoker (Yes/No)
- Region (Geographical region)
- Charges (Medical insurance charges)
- This project involves cleaning the data, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and using machine learning algorithms to predict insurance charges.

## Data Overview
# The dataset used in this project is insurance.csv, which contains the following columns:
- age: The age of the insured individual.
- sex: The gender of the individual (male or female).
- bmi: The BMI (Body Mass Index) of the individual.
- children: The number of children/dependents covered by the insurance.
- smoker: Whether the individual is a smoker (yes or no).
- region: The geographical region of the individual.
- charges: The total medical insurance charges for the individual.
- Analysis and Models
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Cleaning: Handling missing values and outliers.
- Visualization: Using bar charts, histograms, and scatter plots to explore relationships between features and insurance charges.
- Correlation Analysis: Investigating correlations between various features and the target variable (charges).
- Predictive Modeling
- Regression Models: Building machine learning models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor) to predict medical insurance charges based on other features.
- Model Evaluation: Evaluating models using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.

## The repository includes the following dependencies:
- pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- matplotlib and seaborn: For data visualization.
- scikit-learn: For building machine learning models.
- numpy: For numerical operations.
